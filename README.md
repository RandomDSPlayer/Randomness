Welcome to this repo. Remember that I (the
README file) am VERY important. ALWAYS
use me for coding information. if you
want some help in a few programming languages (Java, C++, Erlang (a bit), Monkey X (a bit) and BlitzPlus),
ask RandomDSPlayer.


                                                  THE END
